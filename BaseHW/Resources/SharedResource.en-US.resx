    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>What does Hot Wheels "Base Codes" mean?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="base2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Beginning in 2008, Mattel puts the date of manufacture on the underside of Hot Wheels and Matchbox vehicles. Added a code system that shows This system was called "Base Code". Base Code, vehicle
It consists of a combination that indicates the year it was produced and the week in which it was produced.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="base3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The first character of the Base Code begins with a letter representing the year the vehicle was manufactured, followed by numbers indicating which week of the year of manufacture the vehicle was produced. For example, if a base code is "B30", it indicates that this vehicle was manufactured in week 30 of 2009. Similarly, the "P41" base code means it was produced in week 41 of 2021.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="base4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As an important note, "I", "O" and "Q" are not used between letters. In this way, date codes become clearer and more understandable.</value>

    <value>Hot Wheels Blackwalls era, 1977, when Mattel significantly redesigned the Hot Wheels lineup
 It refers to the period between 1988 and 1988. During this time, black walls were used instead of the red lines on the wheels of Hot Wheels cars, giving the cars a more stylish and modern look.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="black2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The era of Blackwalls saw a shift with a focus on more realistic designs and authenticity, with manufacturers like Ferrari, Porsche, and Lamborghini launching a variety of car models inspired by real-life vehicles. This emphasis on realism appealed to an older collector and fan base with an interest in Blackwalls era cars with their detailed designs and high-quality builds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="black3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alongside the new black walls, the Blackwalls era also introduced the use of chrome-plated plastic in some car parts, a new plastic windshield design, and a wider range of body styles and paint schemes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="black4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Popular with collectors and fans, the era of Blackwalls ended in 1989 with the start of the Hot Wheels Blue Card era, when more detailed and realistic cars were offered with tires as well as other advanced features. But still, the Blackwalls era remains an important period in Hot Wheels' history, and many collectors still take an interest in and value these classic cars today.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="blue1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hot Wheels Blue Cards refers to the line of Hot Wheels cars produced by Mattel from 1989 to 1994. Also referred to by some as the "Collector Number" era. Blue Cards was a redesign of Hot Wheels packaging that was previously available in yellow and red packaging for over 20 years.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="blue2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Blue Card era was characterized by a blue and silver packaging and design with a more modern look. The packaging also contained a clear plastic blister pack that allowed collectors to see inside the car without removing it from the package.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="blue3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alongside the new packaging design, the Blue Card era introduced more detailed and realistic designs to the Hot Wheels lineup, as well as new features such as working suspensions and opening doors.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="blue4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Despite the popularity of the Blue Card era among collectors, it ended in 1995 with the introduction of the Hot Wheels Treasure Hunt series. In this new series, even more detailed and highly collectible cars were featured with unique paint schemes and designs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="blue5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Today, Hot Wheels Blue Karts remain popular with collectors and fans alike, with many looking for rare and hard-to-find models from this era. While the Blue Card era isn't as nostalgic as earlier eras like Redlines or Blackwalls, it remains an important period in Hot Wheels' history and is a valuable part of serious collector's collections.</value>
